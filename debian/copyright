 Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
 law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
 so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
 United States without permission and without paying copyright
 royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
 of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
 concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
 and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
 the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
 of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
 copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
 easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
 of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
 Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
 do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
 by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
 license, especially commercial redistribution.
